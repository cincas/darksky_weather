# Tech Challenge - Dark Sky Weather
The task is to create a basic app that makes a call to a weather (RESTful) web service, and display the data that is returned in the response on the screen of the mobile app, changing the interface (UI) according to the forecast being returned (clear, sunny, raining, etc.). The app only needs to make a single call at launch.

## Key elements

- Use of suitable design patterns, and a strict separation of concerns when developing a mobile application
- Information about multiple days forecast shown on the screen
- At least one user interaction (such as scrolling or tapping to get more info)
- Correct use of the application life cycle, management of the UI thread, and async development principals when displaying data and making network calls
- There should be some evidence of testing to demonstrate the code is testable



## Requirements

- Xcode 9
- Swift 4
- iOS 9.0+ 
- CocoaPods



## Installation

```
cd /path/to/project/DarkSkyWeather
pod install
open DarkSkyWeather.xcworkspace
```
